- 👋 Hi, I’m @SSUMM
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things! Art, crafts, cooking, politics, small business and right now I'm taking the leap from mainframe to Java. Wish me luck, I need it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really...
- 📫 If you wish to contact me, email me at nerdbucket32@yahoo.com.
